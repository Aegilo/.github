## What We Build

**Enterprise Situational Awareness Platform (GSOC‑grade)** — one live map that unifies incidents, assets, routes, and evolving risk.

- Live fused map: OSINT/news, sensors, and field comms in one view
- Event correlation: link related incidents; prioritize by proximity and context
- Dynamic danger zones: geofences that adapt as events evolve and decay
- Analyst‑in‑the‑loop: AI proposes, humans confirm; every decision is logged
- Orchestration & playbooks: notify, reroute, dispatch, and open tickets across channels
- Evidence & reporting: audit‑ready timelines for insurers, auditors, and boards
- Enterprise integrations: VMS/CCTV, access control, messaging, ITSM, identity, APIs

## How We Work

- Quick Start (≤72 hours): connect sources, tune alerts, go live
- Proof of Value (30 days): deploy at priority sites, track ROI and MTTA/MTTR
- Enterprise Scale: SSO/RBAC, custom sources, governance, and KPI dashboards

Privacy‑by‑design and explainable by default: provenance on every alert and action.

## Who We Serve

- Corporate/GSOC security teams at multi‑site enterprises
- Site and regional operations managers (logistics, plants, venues, retail)
- Threat‑intel/OSINT analysts and security service providers
- Event/venue operators
- Anyone who is mindful of its security

## Why Aegilo

- Defense‑grade engineering; built in Switzerland
- Human‑in‑the‑loop controls with auditability
- Speed to value: minutes from alert to action
