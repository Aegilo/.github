# Aegilo Industries

**Mission:** We build and bring defense‑grade technology to the civilian market—responsibly, securely, and at speed.

**Risk intelligence, built for the real world.**
Aegilo Industries delivers security solutions that fuse intelligence analysis, geospatial data, and AI. We help teams see risks early, act faster, and keep people and assets safe—anywhere.

* **What we do:** Expert risk assessments, live intelligence, and a GSOC-grade platform with danger-zone mapping and real-time alerts.
* **How we do it:** Ex-military and certified analysts paired with engineers and AI specialists—privacy-first and standards-aligned.

## Aegilo Labs

**A boutique AI & autonomy lab turning frontier tech into practical advantage.**
We partner with select teams to prototype fast, ship clean, and scale responsibly. Think Anduril/Palantir energy—applied to private-sector security and operations.

* **Services:** Rapid prototyping, agentic automation, computer vision & edge AI, geospatial analytics, model evaluation & MLOps.
* **Outputs:** Production-ready components, clear runbooks, measurable impact.

## The Aegilo Platform (GSOC)

**Your operations, risk-aware by default.**
A real-time map that understands context: incidents, assets, routes, and evolving risk—all in one pane.

* **Live alerts** with severity and proximity scoring.
* **Danger-zone mapping** with dynamic geofences and event decay.
* **Evidence mode**: privacy-by-design logging for insurer-friendly incident reports.
* **Mobile-ready** for teams on the move.

---

## Geospatial Event Engine (GSEE)

**From “news” to actionable, geolocated events.**
We ingest multi-source OSINT and primary feeds, extract EventMentions, and correlate them into canonical Events with time, place, severity, and confidence.

* **Multi-source fusion** (news, alerts, reports).
* **Link-or-create correlation** to avoid duplicates and stale signals.
* **Structured outputs** that downstream systems and analysts can trust.

---

## Event Spatial Dynamics Engine

**Risk that moves like the real world.**
Events are not dots on a map—they evolve. Our engine models spread, decay, and relevance over time and space, adapting geofences dynamically.

* **Temporal decay** tuned by event type and reliability.
* **Asset-aware scoring**: what matters to you gets prioritized.
* **Scenario hooks** for forecasting and wargaming.

---

## Edge Sensor & Mesh Kit

**Eyes and ears where networks are weakest.**
Jetson-class edge nodes with modular radio and vision pipelines designed for low-latency detection and degraded-comms environments.

* **SDR-based signal awareness** and LoRa/mesh backhaul.
* **On-device inference** for low-bandwidth, high-trust alerts.
* **Drop-in nodes** for watchtower-to-waypoint coverage.

---

## Agentic Ops Suite

**Automation that actually closes the loop.**
Task-specific AI agents orchestrated with guardrails to triage events, enrich context, draft analyst notes, and push decisive actions—no busywork.

* **DTO-clean I/O** for reliable chaining.
* **Human-on-the-loop** controls for auditability.
* **Works with your stack** (graphs, vectors, queues, geospatial DBs).

---

## Geopolitical Risk Forecasting

A disciplined methodology that blends open-source intelligence, scenario planning, and model-assisted scoring to inform decisions—pricing, travel, and duty of care.

* **Structured events → risk scores** you can reason about.
* **Brier-score mindset** for measurable forecast quality.
* **Analyst-friendly UX** with source grading and confidence.



## Graph-Native Memory (R\&D)

**Give AI long-term memory that makes sense.**
A temporal, graph-centric memory layer that links people, places, events, and evidence so agents recall and reason—safely and explainably.

* **Temporal graphs + vectors** for similarity and chronology.
* **Geo-queries** and ontology-aware linking.
* **Designed for auditability** in regulated environments.

---

## Why Aegilo

* **Dual-DNA:** battle-tested security tradecraft + modern AI engineering.
* **Explainable by design:** every alert, score, and recommendation comes with provenance.
* **Privacy & ethics:** European standards, built-in from day one.
* **Speed to value:** start with practical wins, scale to full platforms.
